ðŸŽ­ Sentiment Analysis with Metaflow
================

This repository contains code following the [Natural Language Processing with Metaflow](https://outerbounds.com/docs/nlp-tutorial-overview/) tutorial.

I've made some changes to the original tutorial to make it more readable, organized and robust.

Here I learn how to build, train, test, and deploy a machine learning model that performs text classification. I use Pytorch, Scikit-learn, and Metaflow to operationalize a machine learning product using best practices for evaluating and testing. Lastly, I learn how you can use this model in downstream processes.
